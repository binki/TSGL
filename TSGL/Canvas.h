/*! \class Canvas
 *  \brief A GL window with numerous built-in, thread-safe drawing operations
 *  \details Canvas provides an easy-to-set-up, easy-to-use class for drawing various shapes.
 *  \details With libpng and libjpeg, Canvas also supports the drawing of images.
 *   \details On top of being easy to use, Canvas is also thread-safe, so any number of images may be drawn at once.
